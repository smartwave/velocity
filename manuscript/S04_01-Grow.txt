SALES PROFILE
Any company/organization that uses technology needs expertise to bring strategy and focus to technology. In large companies, that role falles to a CIO, who can align technlogy to business needs and process (at least, the good ones do). Most small businesses can't afford a full-time CIO. SmartWave helps those businesses by providing consultative services as needed, helping small businesses make technology a more active part of their business' development.

OUR BEST SALES FITS
We fit well with any size business that is considering or in the process of a complex technical project, but our ongoing service is suited for companies that are $500K+ in annual revenue up to about 300 employees.

Our buyers are typically the CEO/CFO (financial), COO (technical) and the "IT people" are our users. 

BUYER PROFILES
Who is the buyer?
What do they want/what is their challenge?
What is most important to them?
What/whom do they trust?

WHAT WE OFFER
We offer the following classifications of services:
Intensive Technology Team Management - retainer service to oversee all technical operations on a weekly/daily basis
Lean Technical/Operational Governance - retainer service to oversee technical operations and strategy on a monthly/quarterly basis
Technical Audits - detailed evaluation and rating of technical systems/practices/operations, business processes, risk and opportunity (could be for any technology, technical human resource(s), or business process)
Technical Assessments/Selections - Rapid evaluation of people/process/systems relating to technology, building a lean roadmap and aiding in rapid system selection
Technical Project Management - Acting on behalf of the client 


### The Dreaded Business Plan
Great gugga mugga these things are boring to write and can be more boring to read! I like to see the business plan as your organization's exciting novel. It should have its own story arc and remain interesting. It should also LOOK INTERESTING, so make sure to hire a designer if you want to grab someone's attention.

Most financial folks that read this zip through the Exec summary, bounce to the financials section, then read bits and pieces of the document, making all your hard work seem like a waste. Make it interesting; infuse your team's personality.
