# Aligning to the Velocity Mindset
Oh good! You're still here. Now that you have decided to "stay in Wonderland and see how deep the rabbit hole goes", I think it's important that we get our thinking aligned. So much like Neo in the _"The Matrix"_, you've swallowed the red pill and we can begin tracking your biolectric pattern to save you from the old brain ways of thinking about business AKA "the machines".

## Outcomes
Clarify the foundation of the tools outlined in the book so you know how to approach them. You will either know as much as you do about your motivations to run a business or more. 

You will have an understanding of the basic philosophy that drives modern business growth. If we were ever to meet in person, we would understand each other and be able to talk about business tactics without either of us stopping to explain why we are considering the human or environmental cost of the tactic. 

All methods are not for all people or situations. Velocity is geared for invididuals and groups seeking growth without sacrificing personal values or ethics. 

Why do people buy things?

Why do people choose to work at a place? 

Because they indentify a perceived value that the decision satisfies.

## Premises of Velocity
One of the personal leaps of faith I have taken in my life is the following theory, that people are inherently good natured and want to make the decision which has the least harm on others and themselves. Sometimes, people make decision that harm others because they become more focused on their interest and self-preservation. This line of thinking has had disastrous consequences, from wars to genocide and man-made calamities to nature. Perhaps I have had a relatively lucky life, but this theory has held true with few exceptions. 

Another theory I have elected to follow is that people make decisions based on who they are, what they have experienced and what or whom they want to become. 

These are important concepts and are at the core of how I interact with the world. They are also the basic premise on which the practices in this book are outlined. For you, reader it is not a "make or break" that you take the same leaps. I felt it important to express this, as it might skew perceptions on how to implement the methods outlined.
