The Role of the CIO
	1. Chief "Infrastructure" Officers focus on cost reduction, and account for 65% to 70% of the overall IT budget. Most of this CIO persona's projects prioritize keeping the lights on and managing legacy environments. Disruptive technologies such as virtualization and cloud will play a key role in cost reduction. These infrastructure officers tend to focus on the technology side and internal-facing activities.
	2. Chief "Integration" Officers connect internal and external ecosystems. With 5% to 10% of the overall budget, this CEO persona must bring together a hodge-podge of business processes, data, systems, and connection points with legacy systems and newer cloud-based approaches. Projects touch external systems and often address post-merger integration environments. These integrators tend to focus on the technology side and both internal and external activities.
	3. Chief "Intelligence" Officers empower the business with actionable insights. Representing between 10% and 15% of the overall budget, this CIO persona must improve business-user access to information. A key theme includes placing the right data to the right person at the right time on the right interface. These intelligence officers tend to focus on the business side and internal facing activities.
	4. Chief "Innovation" Officers identify disruptive technologies for pilot projects. Investing 5% to 10% of the overall budget, this CIO persona must drive innovation on a shoestring. Typically from business backgrounds, these leaders move fast, fail fast, and move on. They tend to focus on the business side and external activities.

How We Manage
How We Change It

Pressurizing can be great. But what happens when your business or structure isn't able to handle the added pressure and speed that comes with change and growth? Sometimes leaks happen. Sometimes stress cracks form and present more costs and problems down the road. And sometimes the vessel bursts. 
Venturi Effect

# Get in a Meeting Ryhtym and DON'T BREAK IT. EVER!
# Make the most of yoru team's time together (Meetings); send agendas, do the prep work
# Make the most of each individual's time by giving them all the tools they need and clearly defining their path forward

### Setting Goals for the Quarter
Tools
* Scorecard

It is helpful to break your long-term vision into a yearly goal, then break that farther down to quarterly milestones. Why? Because eating an elephant takes a lot of stamina, and not everyone will initially see your vision. So make it easy for them by giving them more bite-sized chunks to complete first. As your team successfuly hits goals, they will stay motivated and start to buy into your vision, and might evne want to push farther faster.

# Choose your quarterly goals
# Identify which members of the team (leadership or ptherwise) are key in meeting those goals
# Identify what each key team member will do for each goal (not everyone will participate in each goal at the team level, but they will at the leadership level)

### Know your Team
For each member of your team, it heelps to know this about each

#### Conflict Is Key
Alwyas ask Why. How Could This Be Better? Are we delivering value? Are we holding true to our values?

### Document Your Processes into a Manual
Make sure to make the language your own. Don't use a template that doesn't sound like it comes from your company or is in the language your team uses.

From Traction.
* Identify key processes
* Identify steps in the process
* Document how to do each step

Knowing your team is critical. You need to know their strengths and weaknesses and they need to know yours.

#### Managing Communication
# Junk - clear it out
# Informational - Decide how you want to review this, monthly, weekly, daily?
# Response - Someone else is supposed to respond or you must. Determine how fast you want to respond and if someone should notify you that you need to respond (and how you want to be notified)

##### Make it CLear your goals, model and process for all to see
