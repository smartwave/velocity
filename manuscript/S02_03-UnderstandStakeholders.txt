### Your Market, Early Adopters and Your Pitch
Tools
* SW(O)T - Tried and true
* Buyer Persona Modeling
* The Lean Pitch

Before defining your business model, you must define your market and know your customer. Otherwise, you might be designing something that is neither wanted or needed! Having this deep understanding is crucial not only for honing your product/service, but to communicate effectively with stakeholders, customers and partners. This culminates in the entire team having a common way to explain the business model, the market and customers.
