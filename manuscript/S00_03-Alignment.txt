# Alignment - Is this for me?
Before we get started, we need to make sure we are on the same page. We should also make sure that reading this book is worth your time. Time is unique in that way: it was created by mankind but is our only _truly_ limited resource. So let's use it wisely.

“Individual commitment to a group effort – that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.”
-http://www.vincelombardi.com/quotes.html

This quote was made by a guy who loved football and loved winning. It could have been said by Benjamin Franklin, Nelson Mandela, Winston Churchill or Mahatma Ghandi. Instead it was said by a guy who chose football over preisthood. Maybe his numeroues quotes strewn about through modern business talks were inspired by his first calling. Or maybe he just wanted to inspire his team to beat the crap out of the competition. Either way, it worked. Vince Lombardi was a winning coach, and even if your team doesn't want to run over the competition and leave them bleeding in the mud we can pull little gems like the above quote out and apply it for our own purposes here.

Using this quote as a basis, the methods contained herein assume the following:
* Your 'group' extends beyond your company to your family, your community, your country, the world and the environment. 
* A "group effort" isn't just a single goal, it is a collection of values, purpose and goals that can drive each decision we make
* _You_ believe the concept of "do little/no harm" is something people and business should practice
* Organizations can have a huge positive or negative impact on society
* Doing 'the right thing' is usually the more difficult option
* Entrepreneurs want to solve a problem or create a lifestyle, not make gobs of money

You might disagree with some or all of these assumptions. And that is totally fine. You are welcome to stop now. However, if you are still curious what these assumptions mean or how to hold true to value AND drive business growth, please read on. 

You won't be disappointed.
