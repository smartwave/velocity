That would mean that with greater experience and experimentation, risk goes down and revenue increases.<IMG>What does design/Test do? It takes the messy, non-linear process (searching) of determining what to build/do next and smoothes it out, to prepare it for exection. During the search phase, invention happens. Invention is messy. Search also is recurrant.During the Execution phase, improvements happen. Improvements increase efficiency. Yay!Managing execution and managing the future/search are very different skills, and not always the same person. -Alex Osterwalderhow do you measure prestige in your organization?

The accidental entrepreneur## What is the mindset of a "good" leader?* Organizations can have a huge positive or negative impact on society ## Servant Leadership, Velocity EditionServant Leadership has been a concept in business since the 1980s. The basic tenant is that the leader sets the direction and then creates and environment that encourages or supports the team to achieve that vision. I think the idea is sound and fosters competition for best practices in human resources, productivity and culture. Although I believe the model itself is a bit outdated, rooted more in academic theory than application. It's a good start, but I think we can improve upon that concept by talking about it in terms of how it is applied. We'll work that out by applying it throughout our tactics in the later chapters.Our more modern interpretation of Servant Leadership will help us frame the mindset for  success in the world we live in today. It will shape a vision of the future, provide a framework to make decisions, connect with people's intrinsic values and inspire true innovation. Let's start by identifying what the job of a servant leader (or any leader) should be. Is it enough to just create an environment that people want to work at? How does each person's "perfect workplace" contribute to the success of the organizationI'd like to provide a definition of what a modern servant leader should do. A modern servant leader should _Provide an environment that makes it easy to be great and hard to hold things back._ The goal of a leader is to provide fertile ground for others to achieve good or great things. For and entrepreneurs and leaders that follow this, you will inspire a team of people to build a vision while building a community. Business owners you provide this environment will reap the rewards of creativity, efficiency and lower costs. Your people will flourish and you along with them.Shouldn't I try to jsutify that somehow? Perhaps you, dear reader want some extra justification for what benefits you will receive by being a modern servant leader.* It will be easier to attract talent because people will _seek you out_ as a preferred place to work* New talent will be aligned with your culture because it is well defined* There will be less turnover as people will want to stay where they are a part of something larger than themselves* Your products and services will be more valuable to your customers because you will have more brains (your entire team) helping to improve things* Customer service will be improved because your team will see that as a necessary part of fulfilling their purpose* Internal communication will be more streamlined because everyone feels they are on the same team* It will be easier to create marketing materials because you won't have to imagine how to present yourselves; you'll be able to tell your story authentically because _it will be true_* Custoemr acquisition will go up because your sales process will be focused on specific custoemrs with a specific value proposition, and your team's energy will help you sell* YOU will get more satisfaction out of your work* You will be able to leave a positive legacy because you are making decisions based on your own values
