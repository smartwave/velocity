# FOREWARD

> _Meus vitae opera est mea negotium_
> _Sed mea negotium est non meum vitae_

Do you like Latin? I think I do. I don't really know how to read, write or speak it, but this is the age of online translation tools and I thought it would be cool to open a book with Latin. If it's too outdated, mea culpa.

The notion of "team over self" and "stay true to your values" are constant concepts throughout this book. Though at times, I'm not sure what that means for me. My team has changed over the years as have my values. Given those changes, I feel pretty fortunate that I've found my purpose so early in life: help good people develop fantastic organizations. I've dedicated a lot of time to helping others, sometimes at the expense of relationships or my own well being.  I love the academic side of tinkering with the right models, methods and systems to help any business grow. I also get great joy out of working directly with people. So it's easy for me to get wrapped up in my work and forget that outside of my work, my purpose, there is an incredible world of experiences and opportunities.

So why the Latin? To be honest, seeing it scrawled makes me revisit what it means, Latin not being something I can easily read. It's a reminder to myself to not let my work overtake my life: "My life's work is my business, but my business is not my life." 

This sounds REALLY counterintuitive for a "business book", right? Isn't it common knowledge that running an organization is time-consuming and demanding, requiring dedication of body, mind and spirit. _'We must do what must be done for the greater good of the company!'_ and all that. 

Given how much importance is placed on creating jobs, maintaining profitability and 'grow or die', is it a surprise that the joy of building a business can easily be lost. How many people do each of us know that have sacrificed something important to them for the _"good of the company"_ without receiving any benefit? Most of us are taught to be team players, even if we're the coach. Sacrifice the one to save a few, or the few to save the many. If we have to bend our core values, morals or ethics to get to that next rung on the ladder, by golly we should do it. It's _for the good of the team_. 

At this point I could be talking about sports, war or just pulling random cliches from thousands of movies. So why am I saying all of this to you in the foreward of a "business book"? It's engrained in our culture to accept sacrificing what is most important to us or even others to reach a desireable goal. "This is just the way business is run!" While I agree that reducing staff, wages or other expenses can be necessary during hard times I wonder when it became acceptable to compromise our ethics. Our morals. Our core values. Just to make our profit goals. 

I don't think that compromise is necessary or an effective, sustainable way to run business. This book is a guide to help you build whatever kind of organization you want. I want to help you succeed, and I hope you agree. 

Onward,
