Because I can get so caught up in serving others, I sometimes need a little reminder to to help people like you, and because I love it, I Does this sound silly in a "business book", to question 

Even now, reading it I find myself arguing with the phrase, trying to outsmart it. _"If my business is not my life, then how will I be successful? How will I be the best at my life's work if my business is NOT my life?"_.  

 SSo while I collection of ideasThe above phrase translates about as follows: "My life's work is my business, but my business is not my life". This is the closest I could come to represent the mindset of the inventor, entrepreneur and value-driven grower. It means people who are happy in their work often do what they do because they LOVE something about it. Lifestyle. Technical challenges. Competition. Ego. 

So why publish this for free? Why not make it proprietary, build an app, try to make millions of dollars and cash out? 
-Because I know my life's work: to help others make the world a prosperous place for all living things. So if I want to help others create a prosperous world for all, I figured I should help improve teh "goodness" of one of the most influential forces in our society: the economy and business. By helping thoughtful people to identify, create and grow their value-driven business, B Corp or L3c I am able to achieve my self-identified mission in life.  

The importance of maintaining true to your values can not be underscored. you can use these tactics (or their original form) to try and grow your company. But for most of us, simpyl making money isn't the primary objective any more. This guide is meant to be used by people interested in creating/growing a value-driven business, being good to yoru staff, customers, community and environment all while making a profit.

Sounds pretty altruistic, right? Well, no. I have a faith that is nearly unwavering in aspects of the human spirit. One of those is that, given the choice between two options (one harming another and one with no harm to another) that yield essentially the same benefits, humans (other than sociopaths and those with trained, destructive behavior) will choose to do less harm.

### Vision, Values and Rapid Gap Analysis
Before getting started on any journey, it is helpful to know where you might want to go (even if you haven't determined how exactly you will get there). It's also helpful to have an idea of what your team might need. This helps define a possible destination or end result of our work. This process Doesn't tell us what the business will do, just what it is supposed to help achieve.

### Validating Your "Big Brain's" Ideas
Tools
* Validation Interview

The result of the Validation is the identification the minimum changes required to your current product, service, model or pitch to improve your product or create your Minimum Viable Product. As part of this effort, we need to determine the validation/research method, execute the research and analyze the results.  

#### Research Methods
the timeframe, the number of interviews, whom to interview, 

#### Executing the Reseach/Validation


#### Analyzing the Results

### The Gameplan
The best tactical option is always the one where the least amount of effort yields the most gain. After the Validation effort, your team will have an idea of what your minimum effort should be to make a viable product or measurable change. The short list of changes, tasks and objectives needed to take you from where you are to where you now know you need to be is your Gameplan. For existing businesses, these are your strategic plan. You can create a Gameplan without Validation, but the liklihood that you will be putting effort into a failed idea is much higher. 

How and where do you put your efforts? For startups, it helps to determine the minimum viable product (the least amount of effort to yield a product/service that people will people for). For existing teams, having clearly defined business goals it is the Teams that focus on incremental changes are more focused and achieve faster results. 

Once you know the rules you want to govern yourself by and have a validated business model, pitch and marketplace understanding it is easier to define your minimum viable product. The MVP is the best tactical option,
