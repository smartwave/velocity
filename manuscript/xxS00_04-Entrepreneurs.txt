## On Entrepreneurs
Everyone has a specific definition of what an entrepreneur is. Since we are talking about fostering a specific type of person as an entrepreneur, I think it would be helpful to make sure we interpret the term the same way. 

Let's start by talking about you. You are a leader in an organization and obviously not opposed to risk. You are an entrepreneur. Congratulations! What does that mean?

As far as I can tell, the origination of the word entrepreneur is derived from the French word _entreprende_. This word was used to describe a person, generalyl in the arts or musical production that was an undertaker of great risk. Most likely this was a person who had some non-traditional musical tastes that had a great love or passion for the sounds they heard. They wanted to share their appreciation, thinking others would like these sounds as well. They would end up being overjoyed with the experience or the proud producer of a giant flop. Either way, they took the risk because they _believed in something_.

We are talking about this because it is generally a good idea to understand how you got to the place you are at in life. 

First, I want to ask you a question. Unfortuantely, I can't hear the response through this book. Write down your answers for later reference, and while you're at it post your answer on (SOCIAL MEDIAAAAAAA). 

*Why did you start your business?* In my experience, this is a question that yields a wide range of fascinating answers. From the staunchest conservative to the crunchiest liberal, answers can sound remarkably similar.
"I wanted to help fix bad design."
"I wanted to make money so I could move up in life."
"I saw a problem and knew it needed to be fixed."
"I had a talent and saw an opportuntiy to do what I loved."


### Why Start A Business: The Inventor, The Lifestyle Choice and the Grower
THE ENTREPRENEUR
Lifestyle - A desire to have a certain lifestyle, whether made by freedom of choice or through financial wealth.

Intense Motivation to Solve a Problem - whether a problem you have/face, one you've seen others face, or a problem that is not yet fully realized, the Entrepreneur is intensely motivated to solve that problem

Establish Value - The ability to sell/pitch/present the value of your company and solution to all of your potential customers and stakeholders.

Ability to Envision and implement your Idea to Scale - What separates an individual solo-preneur/project economy worker from the entrepreneur is the ability to envision how your company will work at scale, then begin implementing it through the iterative learning process.

One person can be all three. But it is not as common for someone to be all three at once, and to be good at them at the first try. For a business to scale, it either has to be lucky (right people, right place, right skills, right time) or your leadership team must have these three personalities.

#### The Inventor: Problem Solver (Technician)

#### The Lifestyle: Lifestyle and Impact (Innovator)

#### The Grower: Growth Oriented (Manager)




## How you Stay Motivated
Whether the questions is "why did you start your business?" or "what is your purpose in life" it is likely they are similar, or that one influences the other.

I'd like to ask you another question. Again, post your responses (SOCIAL MEDIAAAA w/ HASHTAG) so I can hear them. *Why do you continue to own/run a business?* This simple question sometimes yields complex answers, but always gives insight into the character of the person answering. This is where we start to sort out innovators and leaders from businesspeople, and can identify your entrepreneurial character. I have asked this question of startup, established and veteran business leaders throughout the years. Another pattern is evident: Usually there is more than one reason selected, but generally speaking people start their business for one or more of the following reasons.

* Satisfy a desire I/we have to create a lifestyle for themselves or others
* Solve a problem that I/we feel can and must be fixed
* Fulfill my/our passion or purpose in life
* Feel good about myself/us 
* Other (OR making lotsa money)

### TIMEOUT!!
This might be a good time to pause. Why is "making lotsa money" at the bottom of the list? Isn't the whole reason we start business and get venture capital money or loans to get filthy rich and sleep on a giant stack of cash like Scrooge McDuck? Isn't money the marker by which all of us are generally measured in the modern world? Doesn't money equal influence, opportunity and therefore power? 

Yes, money may make it easier to take advantage of opportunities and do things that create influence. Yes, that may mean you have greater power over the world around you. Money can also be a means to a lifestyle or to fulfill a passion. So again, why is it at the bottom? I propose the following to you, dear reader: that for those who strive for money, money is a means to an end and not the end itself. 

Do people acquire wealth simply to have it, or do they acquire it for security? Do they want to succeed or to compete and be the "best"? Do they want money because it _is_ influence and power or because it makes it available to them? My experience indicates that whether we are using time, money, beads or land as our method of economic exchange for goods and services it does not matter. We use these as a means to an end, whether that end is intellectual, emotional, spiritual, physical or psychological.

Ready to continue? If you want to discuss or debate this further, let's talk about it (ON SOCIAL MEDIAAAA). TIME IN!!

> Therefore, if money is a means to an end and the means to get to the ends can result in social calamity we want to ensure that the method to acquire the means to the ends are responsible. 

### Review your answers

To some, these answers might seem unrelated to each other. NOt us, though. We see through these statements and see how they are interconnected. _All of these statements indicate a desire to satisfy a deep want to feel good about the way we earn our living._ OK, so people want to feel good about themselves. That seems obvious, right?

Let's move on.
