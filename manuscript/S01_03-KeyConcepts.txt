# Servant Leadership, Velocity Edition
Servant Leadership has been a concept in business since the 1980s. The basic tenant is that the leader sets the direction and then creates and environment that encourages or supports the team to achieve that vision. I think the idea is sound and fosters competition for best practices in human resources, productivity and culture. Although I believe the model itself is a bit outdated, rooted more in academic theory than application. It's a good start, but I think we can improve upon that concept by talking about it in terms of how it is applied. 


We'll work that out by applying it throughout our tactics in the later chapters.

Our more modern interpretation of Servant Leadership will help us frame the mindset for  success in the world we live in today. It will shape a vision of the future, provide a framework to make decisions, connect with people's intrinsic values and inspire true innovation. 

Let's start by identifying what the job of a servant leader (or any leader) should be. Is it enough to just create an environment that people want to work at? How does each person's "perfect workplace" contribute to the success of the organization
I'd like to provide a definition of what a modern servant leader should do. A modern servant leader should _Provide an environment that makes it easy to be great and hard to hold things back._ The goal of a leader is to provide fertile ground for others to achieve good or great things. 

For and entrepreneurs and leaders that follow this, you will inspire a team of people to build a vision while building a community. Business owners you provide this environment will reap the rewards of creativity, efficiency and lower costs. Your people will flourish and you along with them.

Shouldn't I try to jsutify that somehow? Perhaps you, dear reader want some extra justification for what benefits you will receive by being a modern servant leader.
* It will be easier to attract talent because people will _seek you out_ as a preferred place to work
* New talent will be aligned with your culture because it is well defined
* There will be less turnover as people will want to stay where they are a part of something larger than themselves
* Your products and services will be more valuable to your customers because you will have more brains (your entire team) helping to improve things
* Customer service will be improved because your team will see that as a necessary part of fulfilling their purpose
* Internal communication will be more streamlined because everyone feels they are on the same team
* It will be easier to create marketing materials because you won't have to imagine how to present yourselves; you'll be able to tell your story authentically because _it will be true_
* Custoemr acquisition will go up because your sales process will be focused on specific custoemrs with a specific value proposition, and your team's energy will help you sell
* YOU will get more satisfaction out of your work
* You will be able to leave a positive legacy because you are making decisions based on your own values

# GROW OR DIE IS BULLSHIT
-Creating competitive enronvments that stimulate isn't everything. llowing peopel to acheive their own goals is jsut as motivating.


# The Competitiveness of Being Good
Values can change, but they should remain intractable to compromise. 

It is competitively better to be purpose driven. Why?

# The Importance of Teams
 ### The Many Over the One
A tenet of this method is that teams are more effective than individuals. An individual can use these methods alone and be successful, but as most of us aren't going to be lucky enough to have the exact right skills at the right time we will assume that you need a team of people with diverse skills to achieve growth. The challenge here is that building a tightly knit team (or "tribe") is more difficult because you do have to come to a common acceptance of the vision. This can be done by one person laying out the vision, or by helping the team come to consensus. 

# In terms of explosive success, timing and preparation matter

Gather up whatever small balls you have. They can be tennis balls, softballs, whiffle balls, golf balls, or bean bags. Or you can make small "paper basketballs" by tightly wadding up pieces of notebook-sized paper.

Put the balls in a bucket or bag to make them easy to carry.

Find another empty container like a bucket or wastebasket or laundry basket to be the "basket."

Take the paper balls (in their container) and the basket to the nearest park or playground that has a merry-go-round. (Not the kind with horses, but the kind you push around then hop on and ride.)

Place the basket on the ground about 3 or 4 meters (9 to 12 feet) from the merry-go-round. Then, step up on the merry-go-round with your container of balls.

Without moving the merry-go-round, try tossing a few balls into the basket on the ground.

Now, leaving the container of balls on the merry-go-round, hop off, push it to get it going slowly (or have someone else push it), then hop back on.

Now, try tossing the balls into the basket on the ground as you go around.

Adding the motion makes it a lot harder to hit your target, doesn't it? Now imagine the target is on another spinning merry-go-round on the other side of the playground. Even if your paper balls were real basketballs or baseballs, you'd have a lot of trouble.
What you will probably find out is that . . .

Timing is everything!
