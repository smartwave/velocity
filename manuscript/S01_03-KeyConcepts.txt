### The difference between an inventor, an entrepreneur and a business owner
One person can be all three. But it is not as common for someone to be all three at once, and to be good at them at the first try. For a business to scale, it either has to be lucky (right people, right place, right skills, right time) or your leadership team must have these three personalities.

#### The Inventor: Problem Solver (Technician)

#### The Lifestyle: Lifestyle and Impact (Innovator)

#### The Business Owner: Growth Oriented (Manager)

THE ENTREPRENEUR
Lifestyle - A desire to have a certain lifestyle, whether made by freedom of choice or through financial wealth.

Intense Motivation to Solve a Problem - whether a problem you have/face, one you've seen others face, or a problem that is not yet fully realized, the Entrepreneur is intensely motivated to solve that problem

Establish Value - The ability to sell/pitch/present the value of your company and solution to all of your potential customers and stakeholders.

Ability to Envision and implement your Idea to Scale - What separates an individual solo-preneur/project economy worker from the entrepreneur is the ability to envision how your company will work at scale, then begin implementing it through the iterative learning process.

# The Importance of Teams
 ### The Many Over the One
A tenet of this method is that teams are more effective than individuals. An individual can use these methods alone and be successful, but as most of us aren't going to be lucky enough to have the exact right skills at the right time we will assume that you need a team of people with diverse skills to achieve growth. The challenge here is that building a tightly knit team (or "tribe") is more difficult because you do have to come to a common acceptance of the vision. This can be done by one person laying out the vision, or by helping the team come to consensus.
