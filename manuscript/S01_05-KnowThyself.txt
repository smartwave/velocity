# Know Yourself
 ## Exercise - Define Your Purpose
Ask yourself these questions:
What is my purpose?
What am I better at than everyone else? (Malcolm Gladwell: Outliers)
-Secret: look to your own experiences up to this point in your life.
What is my experience in that area?

  ## PURPOSE
What do I love doing that I want to do forever?
What would I regret not being/doing/having for myself if my life were to end at this moment?

 ## Define Your Values
