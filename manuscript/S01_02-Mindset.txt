# The Servant Leader Example
The goal of a leader is to provide fertile ground for others to achieve good or great things. 

Servant Leadership is a concept that can help us frame the mindset for modern success. I think the model itself is a bit outdated, rooted more in academic theory than application. We'll work that out by applying it throughout our tactics in the later chapters.

I'd like to provide a definition of what a modern servant leader should do. A modern servant leader should _Provide an environment that makes it easy to be great and hard to hold things back._ For and entrepreneurs and leaders that follow this, you will inspire a team of people to build a vision while building a community. Business owners you provide this environment will reap the rewards of creativity, efficiency and lower costs. Your people will flourish and you along with them.

Shouldn't I try to jsutify that somehow? Perhaps you, dear reader want some extra justification for what benefits you will receive by being a modern servant leader.
* It will be easier to attract talent because people will _seek you out_ as a preferred place to work
* New talent will be aligned with your culture because it is well defined
* There will be less turnover as people will want to stay where they are a part of something larger than themselves
* Your products and services will be more valuable to your customers because you will have more brains (your entire team) helping to improve things
* Customer service will be improved because your team will see that as a necessary part of fulfilling their purpose
* Internal communication will be more streamlined because everyone feels they are on the same team
* It will be easier to create marketing materials because you won't have to imagine how to present yourselves; you'll be able to tell your story authentically because _it will be true_
* Custoemr acquisition will go up because your sales process will be focused on specific custoemrs with a specific value proposition, and your team's energy will help you sell
* YOU will get more satisfaction out of your work
* You will be able to leave a positive legacy because you are making decisions based on your own values



Because we aren't just tyring to help responsible businesses grow. We want value and purpose-driven people to succeed faster and more often than people who are driven by power or their own benefit at the cost of others.

go for organic?

-is fresh better for nutritional value?
-how do you decide


As I continued careening through life, I began to  life Over the course of my life I have been witness to mild examples of the joyous and hurtful ways humans can treat each other.

The entire philosophy behind this model and all the work I do and all of the experiences I have had is this: given the choice, a human being will always choose the option that is least likely to do harm to something else AND will more often choose an option that will produce a benefit for others, with the following caveats:
-the solution has to benefit the chooser
--the chooser has to feel connected somehow to the impact of the "good" option
-the chooser has to trust that the outcome will actually be "good"
--Considering, planning or discussing the "good" option doesn't make the chooser feel too uncomfortable
--The "good" solutions can not take too many more resources (time, money) to execute than the other options
-the chooser has to know what "good" is

The cynic in me (and possibly in you) looks at this list and could probably add more. For the sake of a fair argument, let's just assume that the above is all true, that people don't want to make decisions that create a negative impact. So we also have to accept the caveats, and I think there are two realizations that present themselves:
* Each of the caveats is specific to each individual or group that is making the choice
* The reality of our civilization makes it harder to do good 

Why do people do the work they do? What drives someone to be excellent? 

These exercises will help you document important informatio nthat will drive your busines' growth without compromising your values. They can also be insightful ways for you, your partners or your team to get to now themselves and each other better.
