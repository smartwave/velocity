# Build Your World
Starting a company is easy. Growing it is hard. Really hard, especially if it is your first business.



 ### Building Your World: Running/Starting/Growing a Business
WEre you ever one of those people to play Sim City, Civilization or any game that requires you to build a world from the ground up? If you were, you can appreciate how comparable those games have become to the task of running a business. Morale, safety, economic health and prosperity of the people are all intertwined. More importantly that that interconnectedness is the player's mood or personality. Who a person is and what they value will guide every decision that is needed in the game, which can be a inderance in some situations and a blessing in others. A person that favors winning at all costs might be willing to sacrifice people or allies, while someone adverse to conflict might opt for economic superiority. 

In these games as in real life, your personal vision, desire for impact, goals and values guide each decision you make.
