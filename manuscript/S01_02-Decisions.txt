# Be a Good Decider
One of the personal leaps of faith I have taken in my life is the following theory, that people are inherently good natured and want to make the decision which has the least harm on others and themselves. Sometimes, people make decision that harm others because they become more focused on their interest and self-preservation. This line of thinking has had disastrous consequences, from wars to genocide and man-made calamities to nature. Perhaps I have had a relatively lucky life, but this theory has held true with few exceptions. 

Another theory I have elected to follow is that people make decisions based on who they are, what they have experienced and what or whom they want to become. 

These are important concepts and are at the core of how I interact with the world. They are also the basic premise on which the practices in this book are outlined. For you, reader it is not a "make or break" that you take the same leaps. I felt it important to express this, as it might skew perceptions on how to implement the methods outlined.

Most of this section will revolve around making decisions.

Clarify the foundation of the tools outlined in the book so you know how to approach them. You will either know as much as you do about your motivations to run a business or more. 

You will have an understanding of the basic philosophy that drives modern business growth. If we were ever to meet in person, we would understand each other and be able to talk about business tactics without either of us stopping to explain why we are considering the human or environmental cost of the tactic. 

All methods are not for all people or situations. Velocity is geared for invididuals and groups seeking growth without sacrificing personal values or ethics. 

* How to decide with values
* Sometimes that means sacrifice
* Difficult to manage values, customer needs, profits and staff. 


## Decisions
Why do people buy things?

Why do people choose to work at a place? 

Because they indentify a perceived value that the decision satisfies.

## Making Decisions
Here is where we need to take a minute, to have some mental space to think. Because I am not just trying to help responsible businesses grow. We want value and purpose-driven people to succeed faster and more often than people who are willing to benefit at the expense of others. Please indulge me for a bit.

You've started a business. I asked why. 

You still want to run a business. Obviously you are a masochist, but I asked why anyways.

Outside of those answers is the process you went through to make those decisions and stay committed to them. 

Did you read the Foreward to this book? Remember when I stated that this book was meant for business leaders that want to do good in the world through their business? I really hope you do. I enjoyed writing that. 

If you didn't read it, then go back and do it because if you don't agree with those statements then it is going to be very hard for us to get aligned on this point of decision making. 

We are going to clarify a common understanding for two types of decisions: individual decisions and organizational decisions. On individual decision making, we want to understand what motivates people and how to change individual behavior. Organizational decisions are more complex, since they affect a lot of different things like employees, their families, your community, the natural world, customers, partners and so on. 

### Individual Decisions (motivation and behavior change)
Understanding individual decision making helps us motivate and attract, while organizational decision making 

Understanding why people decide what they do is a complicated thing to try and do, which is why we needed this time together to think. We aren't going to go into the psychology of decision making, but it is important that we have an agreed understanding of the process. After all, business is still driven by human behavior. Until all our cognitive functions are replaced by computer chips, people will have to make decisions on where to work, what to invest in, what to work on, what to buy and what to sell. 

I am fairly sure I have been living with humans on the planet Earth my entire life. Unless I am mistaken, guiding and making decisions is an incredibly important part of business and life. Culture/HR, Marketing, Sales and Recruiting are all heavily dependent on a business leader encouraging decisions that attract people to the company and benefit the business. I hope my point is made how important it is to understand why people make the good and bad choices they do. 

The entire philosophy behind this model and all the work I do and all of the experiences I have had is this: given the choice, a human being will always choose the option that is least likely to do harm to something else AND will more often choose an option that will produce a benefit for others, with the following caveats:
* the solution has to benefit the chooser
** the chooser has to feel connected somehow to the impact of the "good" option
* the chooser has to trust that the outcome will actually be "good"
** Considering, planning or discussing the "good" option doesn't make the chooser feel too uncomfortable
** The "good" solutions can not take too many more resources (time, money) to execute than the other options
* the chooser has to know what "good" is

#### Why do people do the work they do? What drives someone to be excellent? 

### Organizational Decisions

The cynic in me (and possibly in you) looks at this list and could probably add more. For the sake of a fair argument, let's just assume that the above is all true, that people don't want to make decisions that create a negative impact. So we also have to accept the caveats, and I think there are two realizations that present themselves:
* Each of the caveats is specific to each individual or group that is making the choice
* The reality of our civilization makes it harder to do good 

These exercises will help you document important informatio nthat will drive your busines' growth without compromising your values. They can also be insightful ways for you, your partners or your team to get to now themselves and each other better.
