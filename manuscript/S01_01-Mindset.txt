Get aligned to the Velocity mindset. 

Before we get started, we need to make sure we are on the same page.

Human beings have great capacity to cause positive change or terrible suffering for ourselves, each other and our world. The scope of what humans have been able to do both in terms of advancement and suffering in just the last 300 years is incredible, and comparing that to the last 3000 years is pretty staggering. But for the sake of talking abotu business, let's first talk that great engine of human creation: war. The military kind, not the song or the band or even the small personal ones we wage. Real, bloody, horrific war.

So... business isn't war. Not really. I do employ tactical thinking to business, but I won't compare business to war. I think it's a little asinine. In war, people actually die. Hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands. If a company folds, the people in it can find new jobs or seek aid. And if you're the owner, you can dissolve the business, address your creditors and move on with your life. Not so for the big losers in war. 

Even with this dispartiy, war and business share similar tactical ideas. Business development is better with good intelligence, a multi-pronged approach that leverages the terrain, being fully aware of the environment, an ability to see patterns/trends and exploit them and a belief that your team will win. Operations/Production/Administration improves with clear communication, accountability, logistical savvy, technology and delegation. Some of these analogies might be a stretch, but one factor remains crucial to the success of the efforts of war and business. 

Morale.

Once soldiers stop believing they can win or that their cause is worthwhile, they lose. If they are freezing and starving, they desert. When they lose faith in their commander, they mutiny. If things get bad enough they might even go over to the competition. When people in a company don't believe their work is useful, they stop caring and productivity and culture suffer. Over time, either scenario results in increased costs, decreased available time, talent recruitment/retention issues and unhappy stakeholders.

Now comes the $64,000 question: _Why are we talking abotu the effect morale has on war and business?_  Because the people on your team are your greatest asset and are heavily influenced by company morale. When it is high people arey our greatest asset. When morale is low, people cna be your greatest liability. In the book Tribes by ____________ LEvel 4 and 5. 

_Isn't this supposed to be a book about scaling purpose and value-driven people?_ Morale is the nexus of confidence, enthusiasm and discipline. Using the methods outlined in this book, you can create a company with a clear purpose, set of guiding values and cultural feel that is able to keep morale high for you and your team.

A good culture is a safe place. fertile ground

Because we aren't just tyring to help responsible businesses grow. We want value and purpose-driven people to succeed faster and more often than people who are driven by power or their own benefit at the cost of others.



As I continued careening through life, I began to  life Over the course of my life I have been witness to mild examples of the joyous and hurtful ways humans can treat each other.

The entire philosophy behind this model and all the work I do and all of the experiences I have had is this: given the choice, a human being will always choose the option that is least likely to do harm to something else AND will more often choose an option that will produce a benefit for others, with the following caveats:
-the solution has to benefit the chooser
--the chooser has to feel connected somehow to the impact of the "good" option
-the chooser has to trust that the outcome will actually be "good"
--Considering, planning or discussing the "good" option doesn't make the chooser feel too uncomfortable
--The "good" solutions can not take too many more resources (time, money) to execute than the other options
-the chooser has to know what "good" is

The cynic in me (and possibly in you) looks at this list and could probably add more. For the sake of a fair argument, let's just assume that the above is all true, that people don't want to make decisions that create a negative impact. So we also have to accept the caveats, and I think there are two realizations that present themselves:
* Each of the caveats is specific to each individual or group that is making the choice
* The reality of our civilization makes it harder to do good 

Why do people do the work they do? What drives someone to be excellent?

I'm the fortuante product the 90s, raised by middle-class baby boomers that thought their son could do anything he put his mind to. To my knowledge, I've never been held back because of my gender or ethnicity or really known starvation. I have never had to fight in a war to defend my land or my people from tyranny. My parents and my country largely sheltered me from the depravity of economic collapse and the horrors of war and death, even though I knew it was happening around the world somewhere. So for me, life was pretty good and I had no idea where it would take me or what I would do.
 
What is odd about my career is that it didn't start in a job or at a college. It started at a kitchen table with my mother. I was seventeen and my mother asked what I wanted to do with my life. We talked for an hour or so, going back and forth on what the question meant and what I was interested in. I finally came to an answer that felt just right: I want to help people and change the world. It wasn't some altriustic notion. I really wanted to guide a large group of people to change the world. I didn't know how or what we would do, but the world would be better for it. 

It took me close to sixteen years to realize the kitchen conversation was my purpose and my path. 

After a few years, life got in the way and What was most exciting to me then, and still is exciting t, a parent would be happy to hear this kind of altruism.

### The difference between an inventor, an entrepreneur and a business owner
One person can be all three. But it is not as common for someone to be all three at once, and to be good at them at the first try. For a business to scale, it either has to be lucky (right people, right place, right skills, right time) or your leadership team must have these three personalities.

#### The Inventor: Problem Solver (Technician)

#### The Lifestyle: Lifestyle and Impact (Innovator)

#### The Business Owner: Growth Oriented (Manager)

THE ENTREPRENEUR
Lifestyle - A desire to have a certain lifestyle, whether made by freedom of choice or through financial wealth.

Intense Motivation to Solve a Problem - whether a problem you have/face, one you've seen others face, or a problem that is not yet fully realized, the Entrepreneur is intensely motivated to solve that problem

Establish Value - The ability to sell/pitch/present the value of your company and solution to all of your potential customers and stakeholders.

Ability to Envision and implement your Idea to Scale - What separates an individual solo-preneur/project economy worker from the entrepreneur is the ability to envision how your company will work at scale, then begin implementing it through the iterative learning process.

# Know Yourself
 ## Exercise - Define Your Purpose
Ask yourself these questions:
What is my purpose?
What am I better at than everyone else? (Malcolm Gladwell: Outliers)
-Secret: look to your own experiences up to this point in your life.
What is my experience in that area?

  ## PURPOSE
What do I love doing that I want to do forever?
What would I regret not being/doing/having for myself if my life were to end at this moment?

 ## Define Your Values 

# The Importance of Teams
 ### The Many Over the One
A tenet of this method is that teams are more effective than individuals. An individual can use these methods alone and be successful, but as most of us aren't going to be lucky enough to have the exact right skills at the right time we will assume that you need a team of people with diverse skills to achieve growth. The challenge here is that building a tightly knit team (or "tribe") is more difficult because you do have to come to a common acceptance of the vision. This can be done by one person laying out the vision, or by helping the team come to consensus. 


# Building Your World
 ### Building Your World: Running/Starting/Growing a Business
WEre you ever one of those people to play Sim City, Civilization or any game that requires you to build a world from the ground up? If you were, you can appreciate how comparable those games have become to the task of running a business. Morale, safety, economic health and prosperity of the people are all intertwined. More importantly that that interconnectedness is the player's mood or personality. Who a person is and what they value will guide every decision that is needed in the game, which can be a inderance in some situations and a blessing in others. A person that favors winning at all costs might be willing to sacrifice people or allies, while someone adverse to conflict might opt for economic superiority. 

In these games as in real life, your personal vision, desire for impact, goals and values guide each decision you make. 

 ### Making the game
Set the rules
Create teh Model
Get People in the game

 ### Differentiating between Vision, Goals and Impact
Vision is the prescribed destinatation or end result of your efforts. 
Goals are tangible, acheiveable results.
Impact can be tangible or intangible benefits to people or place that are not part of your business. 

# Ambiguity and Failure is OK - Lean 
 ### The supreme value of Failure
No one likes being wrong. Even if the idea has been tried before. Most people's aversion to failure allows our magnificent brains to deceive us into believing that our opinions, guesses, conjecture and ideology are truth. Validation is a simple process that allows a team to confidently say "we might be wrong, but that's OK." This is the single most important concept in starting a business the lean way: it doesn't matter if you are right or wrong. The only thing that matters is that you treat all ideas as hypothesis, validate parts of your hypothesis, adjust what needs to be adjusted and repeat this process regularly. In a funny way, treating everything like a hypothesis that must be tested means your team will never be wrong, you'll just be business scientists always looking for the best way to do everything. 

 #### You're never right until you've proven it
> “That, in my opinion, was the most diabolical aspect of those big brains: They would tell their owners, in effect, ‘Here is a crazy thing we could actually do, probably, but we would never do it, of course. It’s just fun to think about.’

>“And then, as though in trances, the people would actually do it.”

That is a quote from Kurt Vonnegut's novel _Galapagos_, talking about the irrational, ofttimes harmful aspects of human nature to do something without understanding if the effort was worth the reward. _Galapagos_ is a great novel, and while Vonnegut's dark humor resonates throughout there is truth for professionals in his words: our intelligence can yield incredible benefits but can also wreak awesome destruction. It is relevant here because so often the Inventor, Entrepreneur and Business Owner become victims of their own 'big brains'. We think our product is great, or that our idea is revolutionary, or that making this one change will solve all our problems. In reality, we have determined that our opinion (or in the Lean language, our hypothesis) is actually not opinion at all, but truth. This is a highly dangerous proposition for anyone, but much more so for a group of people in an organization whose fates are tied to the health/success of that organization.


When we treat ideas and opinions a hypothesis and test them, we 
to paraphrase Kurt Vonnegut from Galapagos once more, validating our ideas and treating opinion as a hypothesis allows people to not be "diverted from the main business of life by the hobgoblins of opinion.”
