The underlying principles, called the Toyota Way, have been outlined by Toyota as follows:[7][8]

Continuous improvement[edit]
Challenge (We form a long-term vision, meeting challenges with courage and creativity to realize our dreams.)
Kaizen (We improve our business operations continuously, always driving for innovation and evolution.)
Genchi Genbutsu (Go to the source to find the facts to make correct decisions.)
Respect for people[edit]
Respect (We respect others, make every effort to understand each other, take responsibility and do our best to build mutual trust.)
Teamwork (We stimulate personal and professional growth, share the opportunities of development and maximize individual and team performance.)
External observers have summarized the principles of the Toyota Way as:[9]

Long-term philosophy[edit]
Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals.
The right process will produce the right results[edit]
Create continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface.
Use the "pull" system to avoid overproduction.
Level out the workload (heijunka). (Work like the tortoise, not the hare.)
Build a culture of stopping to fix problems, to get quality right from the first.
Standardized tasks are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment.
Use visual control so no problems are hidden.
Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes.
Add value to the organization by developing your people and partners[edit]
Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others.
Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company's philosophy.
Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve.
Continuously solving root problems drives organizational learning[edit]
Go and see for yourself to thoroughly understand the situation (Genchi Genbutsu, 現地現物);
Make decisions slowly by consensus, thoroughly considering all options (Nemawashi, 根回し); implement decisions rapidly;
Become a learning organization through relentless reflection (Hansei, 反省) and continuous improvement (Kaizen, 改善).
