I'm the fortuante product the 90s, raised by middle-class baby boomers that thought their son could do anything he put his mind to. To my knowledge, I've never been held back because of my gender or ethnicity or really known starvation. I have never had to fight in a war to defend my land or my people from tyranny. My parents and my country largely sheltered me from the depravity of economic collapse and the horrors of war and death, even though I knew it was happening around the world somewhere. So for me, life was pretty good and I had no idea where it would take me or what I would do.
 
What is odd about my career is that it didn't start in a job or at a college. It started at a kitchen table with my mother. I was seventeen and my mother asked what I wanted to do with my life. We talked for an hour or so, going back and forth on what the question meant and what I was interested in. I finally came to an answer that felt just right: I want to help people and change the world. It wasn't some altriustic notion. I really wanted to guide a large group of people to change the world. I didn't know how or what we would do, but the world would be better for it. 

It took me close to sixteen years to realize the kitchen conversation was my purpose and my path. 

After a few years, life got in the way and What was most exciting to me then, and still is exciting t, a parent would be happy to hear this kind of altruism.
