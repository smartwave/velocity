Business Plan Outline
“The simple key to the Business Plan is the planning itself...”
While each individual’s business plan will be different, there are common formats which can be used to facilitate the on-going business planning process. The following outline is provided by the Wisconsin Women’s Business Initiative Corporation as a easy-to-use outline.

I like to see the business plan as your organization's exciting novel. It should have its own story arc and remain interesting. It should also LOOK INTERESTING, so make sure to hire a designer if you want to grab someone's attention.

Most financial folks that read this zip through the Exec summary, bounce to the financials section, then read bits and pieces of the document, making all your hard work seem like a waste. Make it interesting; infuse your team's personality.
