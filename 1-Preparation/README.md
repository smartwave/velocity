### Your Market, Early Adopters and Your Pitch
Tools
* SW(O)T - Tried and true
* Buyer Persona Modeling
* The Lean Pitch

Before defining your business model, you must define your market and know your customer. Otherwise, you might be designing something that is neither wanted or needed! Having this deep understanding is crucial not only for honing your product/service, but to communicate effectively with stakeholders, customers and partners. This culminates in the entire team having a common way to explain the business model, the market and customers. 

The Lean Pitch Questions
   * Lean Pitch Outline - SBT (30 min)
      * Who are our customer segments and early adopters?
      * What are the current identified problems our customers have and what alternatives exist?
      * What is our current value proposition and what is the high level concept of our business?
      * What solutions do we offer/provide?
      * What are our key metrics to measure our performance?

### Your Business Model In Concept
Tools
* The Business Model Canvas

Now that your team is on the same page about who your customers are, what they need, what your marketplace looks like and how to communicate those concepts you can begin defining/refining your model. Using the Lean Business Model Canvas as a starting point, your team can further define what work would be required.

### Validating Your "Big Brain's" Ideas
Tools
* Validation Interview

The result of the Validation is the identification the minimum changes required to your current product, service, model or pitch to improve your product or create your Minimum Viable Product. As part of this effort, we need to determine the validation/research method, execute the research and analyze the results.  

#### Research Methods
the timeframe, the number of interviews, whom to interview, 

#### Executing the Reseach/Validation


#### Analyzing the Results

### The Gameplan
The best tactical option is always the one where the least amount of effort yields the most gain. After the Validation effort, your team will have an idea of what your minimum effort should be to make a viable product or measurable change. The short list of changes, tasks and objectives needed to take you from where you are to where you now know you need to be is your Gameplan. For existing businesses, these are your strategic plan. You can create a Gameplan without Validation, but the liklihood that you will be putting effort into a failed idea is much higher. 

How and where do you put your efforts? For startups, it helps to determine the minimum viable product (the least amount of effort to yield a product/service that people will people for). For existing teams, having clearly defined business goals it is the Teams that focus on incremental changes are more focused and achieve faster results. 

Once you know the rules you want to govern yourself by and have a validated business model, pitch and marketplace understanding it is easier to define your minimum viable product. The MVP is the best tactical option, 

## STARTING UP
