## DEDICATION
To Dan, Benjamin and Mike. Without our arguments on business and politics I would never have started or been inspired to share what I've learned with others. I am eternally grateful for our lessons together.

## FOREWARD
Meus vitae opera est mea negotium
Sed mea negotium est non meum vitae

The above phrase translates about as follows: "My life's work is my business, but my business is not my life". This is the closest I could come to represent the mindset of the inventor, entrepreneur and value-driven grower. It means people who are happy in their work often do what they do because they LOVE something about it. Lifestyle. Technical challenges. Competition. Ego. 

So why publish this for free? Why not make it proprietary, build an app, try to make millions of dollars and cash out? 
-Because I know my life's work: to help others make the world a prosperous place for all living things. So if I want to help others create a prosperous world for all, I figured I should help improve teh "goodness" of one of the most influential forces in our society: the economy and business. By helping thoughtful people to identify, create and grow their value-driven business, B Corp or L3c I am able to achieve my self-identified mission in life.  

The importance of maintaining true to your values can not be underscored. you can use these tactics (or their original form) to try and grow your company. But for most of us, simpyl making money isn't the primary objective any more. This guide is meant to be used by people interested in creating/growing a value-driven business, being good to yoru staff, customers, community and environment all while making a profit.

Sounds pretty altruistic, right? Well, no. I have a faith that is nearly unwavering in aspects of the human spirit. One of those is that, given the choice between two options (one harming another and one with no harm to another) that yield essentially the same benefits, humans (other than sociopaths and those with trained, destructive behavior) will choose to do less harm. 

AAsk yourself these questions:
What is my purpose?
What am I better at than everyone else? (Macolm Gladwell: Outliers)
-Secret: look to your own experiences up to this point in your life.
What is my experience in that area?

PURPOSE
What do I love doing that I want to do forever?
What would I regret not being/doing/having for myself if my life were to end at this moment?
