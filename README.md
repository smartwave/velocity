Velocity Business Acceleration Program is a freely shared set of steps and documents that help value-driven businesses grow.

## DEDICATION
To Dan, Benjamin and Mike. Without our arguments on business and politics I would never have started or been inspired to share what I've learned with others. I am eternally grateful for our lessons together.

## FOREWARD
Meus vitae opera est mea negotium
Sed mea negotium est non meum vitae

The above phrase translates about as follows: "My life's work is my business, but my business is not my life". This is the closest I could come to represent the mindset of the inventor, entrepreneur and value-driven grower. It means people who are happy in their work often do what they do because they LOVE something about it. Lifestyle. Technical challenges. Competition. Ego. 

So why publish this for free? Why not make it proprietary, build an app, try to make millions of dollars and cash out? 
-Because I know my life's work: to help others make the world a prosperous place for all living things. So if I want to help others create a prosperous world for all, I figured I should help improve teh "goodness" of one of the most influential forces in our society: the economy and business. By helping thoughtful people to identify, create and grow their value-driven business, B Corp or L3c I am able to achieve my self-identified mission in life.  

The importance of maintaining true to your values can not be underscored. you can use these tactics (or their original form) to try and grow your company. But for most of us, simpyl making money isn't the primary objective any more. This guide is meant to be used by people interested in creating/growing a value-driven business, being good to yoru staff, customers, community and environment all while making a profit.

Sounds pretty altruistic, right? Well, no. I have a faith that is nearly unwavering in aspects of the human spirit. One of those is that, given the choice between two options (one harming another and one with no harm to another) that yield essentially the same benefits, humans (other than sociopaths and those with trained, destructive behavior) will choose to do less harm. 

AAsk yourself these questions:
What is my purpose?
What am I better at than everyone else? (Macolm Gladwell: Outliers)
-Secret: look to your own experiences up to this point in your life.
What is my experience in that area?

PURPOSE
What do I love doing that I want to do forever?
What would I regret not being/doing/having for myself if my life were to end at this moment?

THE ENTREPRENEUR
Lifestyle - A desire to have a certain lifestyle, whether made by freedom of choice or through financial wealth.

Intense Motivation to Solve a Problem - whether a problem you have/face, one you've seen others face, or a problem that is not yet fully realized, the Entrepreneur is intensely motivated to solve that problem

Establish Value - The ability to sell/pitch/present the value of your company and solution to all of your potential customers and stakeholders.

Ability to Envision and implement your Idea to Scale - What separates an individual solo-preneur/project economy worker from the entrepreneur is the ability to envision how your company will work at scale, then begin implementing it through the iterative learning process.

## Let's get aligned
All methods are not for all people or situations. Velocity is geared for invididuals and groups seeking growth without sacrificing personal values or ethics. 

Getting to your velocity has three stages:
* Preparation
* Pressurization
* Maximize Velocity

### The Many Over the One
A tenet of this method is that teams are more effective than individuals. An individual can use these methods alone and be successful, but as most of us aren't going to be lucky enough to have the exact right skills at the right time we will assume that you need a team of people with diverse skills to achieve growth. The challenge here is that building a tightly knit team (or "tribe") is more difficult because you do have to come to a common acceptance of the vision. This can be done by one person laying out the vision, or by helping the team come to consensus. 

### Making the game
Set the rules
Create teh Model
Get People in the game

### Differentiating between Vision, Goals and Impact
Vision is the prescribed destinatation or end result of your efforts. 
Goals are tangible, acheiveable results.
Impact can be tangible or intangible benefits to people or place that are not part of your business. 

### Building Your World: Running/Starting/Growing a Business
WEre you ever one of those people to play Sim City, Civilization or any game that requires you to build a world from the ground up? If you were, you can appreciate how comparable those games have become to the task of running a business. Morale, safety, economic health and prosperity of the people are all intertwined. More importantly that that interconnectedness is the player's mood or personality. Who a person is and what they value will guide every decision that is needed in the game, which can be a inderance in some situations and a blessing in others. A person that favors winning at all costs might be willing to sacrifice people or allies, while someone adverse to conflict might opt for economic superiority. 

In these games as in real life, your personal vision, desire for impact, goals and values guide each decision you make. 

### The supreme value of Failure
No one likes being wrong. Even if the idea has been tried before. Most people's aversion to failure allows our magnificent brains to deceive us into believing that our opinions, guesses, conjecture and ideology are truth. Validation is a simple process that allows a team to confidently say "we might be wrong, but that's OK." This is the single most important concept in starting a business the lean way: it doesn't matter if you are right or wrong. The only thing that matters is that you treat all ideas as hypothesis, validate parts of your hypothesis, adjust what needs to be adjusted and repeat this process regularly. In a funny way, treating everything like a hypothesis that must be tested means your team will never be wrong, you'll just be business scientists always looking for the best way to do everything. 

When we treat ideas and opinions a hypothesis and test them, we 
to paraphrase Kurt Vonnegut from Galapagos once more, validating our ideas and treating opinion as a hypothesis allows people to not be "diverted from the main business of life by the hobgoblins of opinion.” 

#### Potato, Tomatoe: Left Brain or Right Brain
-staying focused and motivated
-behavior change and managements

#### You're never right until you've proven it
“That, in my opinion, was the most diabolical aspect of those big brains: They would tell their owners, in effect, ‘Here is a crazy thing we could actually do, probably, but we would never do it, of course. It’s just fun to think about.’

“And then, as though in trances, the people would actually do it.”

That is a quote from Kurt Vonnegut's Galapagos, talking about the irrational, ofttimes harmful aspects of human nature to do something without understanding if the effort was worth the reward. Galapagos is a great novel, and while Vonnegut's dark humor resonates throughout there is truth for professionals in his words: our intelligence can yield incredible benefits but can also wreak awesome destruction. It is relevant here because so often the Inventor, Entrepreneur and Business Owner become victims of their own 'big brains'. We think our product is great, or that our idea is revolutionary, or that making this one change will solve all our problems. In reality, we have determined that our opinion (or in the Lean language, our hypothesis) is actually not opinion at all, but truth. This is a highly dangerous proposition for anyone, but much more so for a group of people in an organization whose fates are tied to the health/success of that organization.

### The difference between an inventor, an entrepreneur and a business owner
One person can be all three. But it is not as common for someone to be all three at once, and to be good at them at the first try. For a business to scale, it either has to be lucky (right people, right place, right skills, right time) or your leadership team must have these three personalities.

#### The Inventor: Problem Solver (Technician)

#### The Entrepreneur: Lifestyle and Impact (Innovator)

#### The Business Owner: Growth Oriented (Manager)

### Knowing which tool to use
#### For Entrepreneurs/Startups
   * Startup Questionnaire - SBT (15 min)
      * What is the idea?
      * Does it need to be provided? Why?
      * Can it be scaled?
      * What resources are needed?
      * What major milestones must be hit?
      * Is it still an opportunity you want to pursue?

#### For Early Stage
#### For Established Business

Vision - Yearly
Market and Pitch -Quarterly or Biannually
Business Model - Quarterly
Validation - Annually, Biannually, Quarterly, Monthly, Weekly, or Daily
Gameplan - Should immediately follow Validation

### Vision, Values and Rapid Gap Analysis
Before getting started on any journey, it is helpful to know where you might want to go (even if you haven't determined how exactly you will get there). It's also helpful to have an idea of what your team might need. This helps define a possible destination or end result of our work. This process Doesn't tell us what the business will do, just what it is supposed to help achieve.

      * This kind of model requires: (service/relationship level)
      * We will evaluate our success by: 

### Your Market, Early Adopters and Your Pitch
Tools
* SW(O)T - Tried and true
* Buyer Persona Modeling
* The Lean Pitch

Before defining your business model, you must define your market and know your customer. Otherwise, you might be designing something that is neither wanted or needed! Having this deep understanding is crucial not only for honing your product/service, but to communicate effectively with stakeholders, customers and partners. This culminates in the entire team having a common way to explain the business model, the market and customers. 

The Lean Pitch Questions
   * Lean Pitch Outline - SBT (30 min)
      * Who are our customer segments and early adopters?
      * What are the current identified problems our customers have and what alternatives exist?
      * What is our current value proposition and what is the high level concept of our business?
      * What solutions do we offer/provide?
      * What are our key metrics to measure our performance?

### Your Business Model In Concept
Tools
* The Business Model Canvas

Now that your team is on the same page about who your customers are, what they need, what your marketplace looks like and how to communicate those concepts you can begin defining/refining your model. Using the Lean Business Model Canvas as a starting point, your team can further define what work would be required.

### Validating Your "Big Brain's" Ideas
Tools
* Validation Interview

The result of the Validation is the identification the minimum changes required to your current product, service, model or pitch to improve your product or create your Minimum Viable Product. As part of this effort, we need to determine the validation/research method, execute the research and analyze the results.  

#### Research Methods
the timeframe, the number of interviews, whom to interview, 

#### Executing the Reseach/Validation


#### Analyzing the Results

### The Gameplan
The best tactical option is always the one where the least amount of effort yields the most gain. After the Validation effort, your team will have an idea of what your minimum effort should be to make a viable product or measurable change. The short list of changes, tasks and objectives needed to take you from where you are to where you now know you need to be is your Gameplan. For existing businesses, these are your strategic plan. You can create a Gameplan without Validation, but the liklihood that you will be putting effort into a failed idea is much higher. 

How and where do you put your efforts? For startups, it helps to determine the minimum viable product (the least amount of effort to yield a product/service that people will people for). For existing teams, having clearly defined business goals it is the Teams that focus on incremental changes are more focused and achieve faster results. 

Once you know the rules you want to govern yourself by and have a validated business model, pitch and marketplace understanding it is easier to define your minimum viable product. The MVP is the best tactical option,

The Role of the CIO
	1. Chief "Infrastructure" Officers focus on cost reduction, and account for 65% to 70% of the overall IT budget. Most of this CIO persona's projects prioritize keeping the lights on and managing legacy environments. Disruptive technologies such as virtualization and cloud will play a key role in cost reduction. These infrastructure officers tend to focus on the technology side and internal-facing activities.
	2. Chief "Integration" Officers connect internal and external ecosystems. With 5% to 10% of the overall budget, this CEO persona must bring together a hodge-podge of business processes, data, systems, and connection points with legacy systems and newer cloud-based approaches. Projects touch external systems and often address post-merger integration environments. These integrators tend to focus on the technology side and both internal and external activities.
	3. Chief "Intelligence" Officers empower the business with actionable insights. Representing between 10% and 15% of the overall budget, this CIO persona must improve business-user access to information. A key theme includes placing the right data to the right person at the right time on the right interface. These intelligence officers tend to focus on the business side and internal facing activities.
	4. Chief "Innovation" Officers identify disruptive technologies for pilot projects. Investing 5% to 10% of the overall budget, this CIO persona must drive innovation on a shoestring. Typically from business backgrounds, these leaders move fast, fail fast, and move on. They tend to focus on the business side and external activities.

How We Manage
How We Change It

Pressurizing can be great. But what happens when your business or structure isn't able to handle the added pressure and speed that comes with change and growth? Sometimes leaks happen. Sometimes stress cracks form and present more costs and problems down the road. And sometimes the vessel bursts. 
Venturi Effect

# Get in a Meeting Ryhtym and DON'T BREAK IT. EVER!
# Make the most of yoru team's time together (Meetings); send agendas, do the prep work
# Make the most of each individual's time by giving them all the tools they need and clearly defining their path forward

### Setting Goals for the Quarter
Tools
* Scorecard

It is helpful to break your long-term vision into a yearly goal, then break that farther down to quarterly milestones. Why? Because eating an elephant takes a lot of stamina, and not everyone will initially see your vision. So make it easy for them by giving them more bite-sized chunks to complete first. As your team successfuly hits goals, they will stay motivated and start to buy into your vision, and might evne want to push farther faster.

# Choose your quarterly goals
# Identify which members of the team (leadership or ptherwise) are key in meeting those goals
# Identify what each key team member will do for each goal (not everyone will participate in each goal at the team level, but they will at the leadership level)

### Know your Team
For each member of your team, it heelps to know this about each

#### Conflict Is Key
Alwyas ask Why. How Could This Be Better? Are we delivering value? Are we holding true to our values?

### Document Your Processes into a Manual
Make sure to make the language your own. Don't use a template that doesn't sound like it comes from your company or is in the language your team uses.

From Traction.
* Identify key processes
* Identify steps in the process
* Document how to do each step

Knowing your team is critical. You need to know their strengths and weaknesses and they need to know yours.

#### Managing Communication
# Junk - clear it out
# Informational - Decide how you want to review this, monthly, weekly, daily?
# Response - Someone else is supposed to respond or you must. Determine how fast you want to respond and if someone should notify you that you need to respond (and how you want to be notified)

### The Dreaded Business Plan
Great gugga mugga these things are boring to write and can be more boring to read! I like to see the business plan as your organization's exciting novel. It should have its own story arc and remain interesting. It should also LOOK INTERESTING, so make sure to hire a designer if you want to grab someone's attention.

Most financial folks that read this zip through the Exec summary, bounce to the financials section, then read bits and pieces of the document, making all your hard work seem like a waste. Make it interesting; infuse your team's personality.
